Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my PhD research in immunology and cancer.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning spectral cytometry and R for cell population analysis.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving immunology, cancer biology, and advanced cytometry.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with clustering methods and spectral unmixing in R.  
- 💬 Ask me about immunology, cancer research, or cytometry panels with 30+ colors.    
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m fascinated by how Aqua dye can distinguish live and dead cells — it feels like magic in the lab!
